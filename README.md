[Some LOGO]
# Circle Collision
Implementing Different Methods of Circle2Circle Collision Detection using Vulkan Graphics and Compute API  
# Motivation
This Project Is For Learning Purposes of Following Topics
- Collision Detection Algorithms
- SIMD/Vectorization using **AVX** / **AVX2**
- Vulkan Compute Shaders
- Data Oriented Programming

With Collision Detection MEthods:
- Simple (Double For :))
- Spatial Parttioning
  - Grid
  - Quadtree/Octree
  - BSP
  - k-d Trees
  - Bounding Volume 

**This NOT a benchmark, Although It would give me some ideas and thing to be suspicius about.
And also I would appreciate optimization ideas and results on your system.**
