# Circle Collision
Implementing Different Methods of Circle to Circle Collision Detection using Vulkan Graphics and Compute API  

I'll be refering to the simplest collision detection algorithm which has two nested "for"'s **Double For Algorithm**  

# Motivation

This Project Is For Learning Purposes of Following Topics
- Collision Detection Algorithms
- SIMD/Vectorization using **AVX**/**AVX2**
- Vulkan Compute Shaders
- Data Oriented Programming

With Collision Detection MEthods:
- Double For (simplest)
- Spatial Parttioning
  - Grid
  - Quadtree/Octree
  - BSP
  - k-d Trees
  - Bounding Volume

**This NOT a benchmark, Although It would give me some ideas and thing to be suspicius about.
And also I would appreciate optimization ideas and results on your system.**
